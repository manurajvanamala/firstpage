                 <h3>Python</h3>
                 <p class="text">Python is a programming language in which i have been working since a long time.
                     This language helped in creating games such as snake game, pomodoro and Turtles games etc.
                     Also this language helped in understanding and making real User interfaces using some modules such
                     as Turtle,Tkinter and etc . For data handling i have  been using modules like pandas ,numpy and etc.I rate myself
                     about 4.5 out of 5 in this skill as i got lot of familiarity in this language.</p>
